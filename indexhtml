                    <sup><b>10</b></sup> Those childhood moments shaped my values and taught me the importance of family, hard work, and perseverance. 
                    <sup><b>11</b></sup> My love for technology started when I began playing PlayStation at a young age, fueling my curiosity about how games were created. 
                    <sup><b>12</b></sup> This curiosity led me to explore computers, and I would often visit our computer shop just to play. <sup><b>13</b></sup> I spent hours experimenting with different programs, sometimes even breaking them and asking for help to fix them. 
                    <sup><b>14</b></sup> My parents noticed my passion and allowed me to explore computers freely. 
                    <sup><b>15</b></sup> Eventually, I became comfortable navigating the system and learning how different applications worked.
